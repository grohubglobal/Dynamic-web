# dynamic-web

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Hono, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Before Deploying to Cloudflare

When you are ready to deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers, you'll have to make a couple changes.

- Change your url environment variables to match your `*.workers.dev` domains generated by Cloudflare:

```bash
# apps/web/.env
SERVER_URL={your-production-server-domain}

# apps/server/.env
CORS_ORIGIN={your-production-web-domain}

```

- In `apps/server/lib/auth.ts`, uncomment the `session.cookieCache` and `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` sections and replace `<your-workers-subdomain>` with your actual workers subdomain. These settings are required to ensure cookies are transferred properly between your web and server domains.

## Deployment (Cloudflare Wrangler)

- Server dev: cd apps/server && bun dev
- Server deploy: cd apps/server && bun deploy
